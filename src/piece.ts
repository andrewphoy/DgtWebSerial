    // One alternative to this that we used in later versions of 
    // Cray Blitzs and in Crafty as well, is to represent pieces 
    // like this: pawn=1, knight=2, king=3, bishop=5, rook=6 and queen=7. 
    // The advantage of this is that if you AND the piece value with 4, 
    // and get a non-zero result, you know that is a sliding piece. 
    // If the result of the AND is zero, this is not a sliding piece. 
    // 
    // Next, if this is a sliding piece and you AND the piece value with a 1, 
    // and the result is non-zero, you have a piece that can slide diagonally
    // if you AND the piece value with a 2 and the result is non-zero, 
    // you have a piece that slides vertically/horizontally like a rook. 
    // 
    // Note that the queen has both of these bits set and that it can slide 
    // in all 8 directions. This may or may not be useful in your program, 
    // but since it still only requires 3 bits to represent a piece, 
    // there is nothing to lose by using this.
